## About @registry/ Tools

The tools documented here are template implementations designed to help you get started quickly. Each tool in the registry serves as a foundation that you can customize for your specific needs. **We recommend modifying these tools rather than using them as-is** for most production use cases.

These templates cover various categories:
- **Local tools** for file system operations
- **Search tools** for web and data retrieval
- **Sandbox tools** for development environments
- **Miscellaneous utilities** for common tasks
