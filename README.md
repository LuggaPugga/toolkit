## Overview

This registry provides template implementations designed to help you get started quickly with AI tools. Each tool serves as a foundation that you can customize for your specific needs. **We recommend modifying these tools rather than using them as-is** for most production use cases.

- **Search tools** - Web search and data retrieval (Exa, Tavily, Linkup)
